# PaRA Coordinates Tracker

The PaRA Device Coordinates Tracker contains the code for a custom-built device (PaRA) that sends its real-time coordinates to a server via REST API. This device is designed to track and monitor its location, enabling seamless tracking applications.

## Overview

The PaRA device utilizes Arduino and GSM/GPS modules to communicate and retrieve the real-time coordinates. It establishes a connection with the server through RESTful API calls, using the HTTP protocol to transmit the data.

## Key Features

- Real-time Coordinate Transmission: The PaRA device continuously fetches its real-time coordinates from the GPS module and sends them to the server in real-time, ensuring up-to-date location information.
- Arduino-based Implementation: The device is built using Arduino, an open-source electronics platform, providing a flexible and accessible hardware foundation for the project.
- GSM/GPS Integration: The device incorporates GSM and GPS modules to establish a cellular connection and retrieve accurate location data.
- REST API Communication: The device communicates with the server using RESTful API calls, following the principles of REST architecture. It utilizes the HTTP protocol to transmit the data securely and efficiently.
- Data Conversion and Parsing: The device performs data conversion and parsing operations to extract and format the relevant coordinate information before transmitting it to the server.

## Getting Started

To set up the PaRA device and establish the communication with the server, follow the instructions below:

1. Gather the required hardware components, including Arduino board, GSM module, GPS module, and necessary connections.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Configure the Arduino IDE with the necessary libraries and upload the provided sketch to the PaRA device.
4. Set up the server-side implementation, including the REST API endpoints to receive and process the coordinates.
5. Modify the code according to your server's API specifications, including the endpoint URLs, authentication mechanisms, and data handling procedures.
6. Deploy the server-side code to your server or hosting platform.
7. Connect the PaRA device to the power source and ensure proper communication with the GSM and GPS modules.
8. Monitor the PaRA device's functionality and observe the real-time coordinate transmission on the server.
